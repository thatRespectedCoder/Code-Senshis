Problem Statement:

Shravan, a first-year engineering student, is eager to engage in various clubs and events within
his college. However, when he learns about an upcoming event that requires a team of four, he
struggles to find suitable teammates. As he delves deeper, Shravan realizes that many others
share his predicament – students who are interested in participating but face challenges forming
teams.
Further investigation uncovers a broader issue: some students are entirely unaware of ongoing
events, missing out on valuable opportunities. In addition to the previously identified problems,
Shravan discovers that the primary conflicts arise between individual class tests and events
organized by various clubs. The lack of effective communication channels among students
exacerbates these issues, as information about events often gets lost or goes unnoticed.
Motivated by these challenges, Shravan decides to create a comprehensive solution. His aim is
to address not only the team formation problem but also the broader communication gap,
ensuring that students are well-informed about upcoming events despite potential clashes with
exams.
Potential problems to consider:
● The absence of a shared calendar platform akin to Google Calendar hampers students'
ability to visualize and plan their schedules effectively, leading to missed opportunities
and increased stress.
● Students struggle to discover relevant events due to a lack of centralized information or
promotional channels.
● Even when students find potential teammates, there might be issues with skillset
mismatches, hindering effective collaboration.
● Cumbersome or confusing registration processes may discourage students from signing
up for events.
● The absence of a dedicated communication platform could lead to delays,
misunderstandings, and missed opportunities for collaboration.
Shravan's holistic solution should address these additional challenges, providing a
comprehensive platform that facilitates team formation, event discovery, efficient
communication, and seamless coordination among students, clubs, and event organizers
